# Wheat-Plant-Disease
Developed and compared six CNN architectures (VGG16, VGG19, Inception, Xception, ResNet, DenseNet) on a wheat disease image dataset. Performed data preprocessing, augmentation, and model evaluation. Analyzed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. Identified the best-performing architecture based on comparative analysis
